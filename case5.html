                   <p>An early-stage design system was in place for the DailyPay that met the fundamental styling requirements for the website. As our team collaborated more with external teams and freelancers, it revealed an opportunity to expand the library. My ambition was to better manage our designs with unity and improve efficiency between cross-functional teams.</p>
                   <p>Goals that guided the process:</p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>Create an easier transition when onboarding an outsourced freelancer or contractor</li>
                       <li>Make our file handoffs to external agencies seamless</li>

                   <p>A competitive analysis was conducted based on four other cloud-based storage systems: Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, and Evernote. All offer the ability to save, organize and share content for collaborating. While Dropbox has no limitations in file size uploads, it does not allow for an entire folder upload through its web application. Google Drive comes with a generous 15GB of free storage, but it’s shared amongst the email inbox and other apps within its online suite. OneDrive also offers generous free storage, but like Google Drive it requires an email account associated with its service.  Evernote has a smart and easy-to-use way of creating text-based notes, but it only allows for two devices to be used simultaneously under one account. Given the research, I was able to determine my product should be multi-device friendly with a simple uploading process and streamlined for sharing and collaborating.</p>

                   <p>While in dashboard, a number of issues were discovered. The group was asked to create a text-based note, however, due to crowded navigation in the dialog box and unclear CTAs to complete the task users were left confused and frustrated. I took this feedback and separated the CTAs from the other clickable icons. This gave more breathing space to the CTAs, creating the needed focal point.</p>

                   <h2>Creating the Brand</h2>
                   <p>With an understanding of the platform and its audience, the brand identity was created to capture the essence of the application. Stoa mirrors its definition as a place where social gatherings took place with all types of communications exchanged during the ancient Greece period. The logo abstracts the structural forms surrounding this historical architectural feature.</p>
                   <p>The colour palette would need to reflect the credibility and reliability of the application. The selected varying shades of teal serves to support the brand’s identity.</p>
                   <p>The type system utilizes Open Sans as the body copy for its sans-serif friendliness and easy-to-read open curves. With its block-like appenditures, Roboto Slab is applied to headlines to express the brand’s solidity and confidence.</p>

                   <p>It was beneficial to have performed several tests in the beginning stages. A number of design feature flaws were overlooked and I was able to iron out a number of these issues before testing the prototype.</p>

                   <h3>reflection</h3>
                   <p>With Stoa, I learned the importance of responsive design. Initially, I was challenged by designing for web-only and not thinking about mobile-first. Not having done so set up roadblocks where I had to redesign layouts so the pages would flow seamlessly across devices of all sizes. In turn, this ate up time where I could have put towards more usability testing.</p>
                   <p>I also learned how easy it is to overlook simple design features that is not user-friendly. Something that is designed to my satisfactory will not necessary be as accommodating when it’s placed in a functional environment. The series of user tests I did in the wireframing stages were the most helpful in setting the path. </p>
                   <p>Given more time, I would like to further develop the team collaborating feature. This was a frustration voiced through the user interviews. However, due to the limited time allowed for the project the feature was not realized. If possible, I would like to place the focus on a chat function built-in to the application to enhance team collaborating.</p>
