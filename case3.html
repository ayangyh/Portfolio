                   <h2>Overview</h2>
                   <p>The organization had undergone a full rebrand with the website redesign outsourced under tight deadlines. As an international contractor, I joined the team to help the implementation of the update before becoming more involved as the staff composition changed. My first project in this expanded role was to bring the resource center into the new design while improving its usability.</p>
                   <p>Goals that guided the process:</p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>Give users control in finding their desired information</li>
                       <li>Enchance overall scannability</li>
                       <li>Make the large volume of content more digestible</li>

                   <h3><b>The importance of a content audit</b></h3>
                   <p>Much of the time was spent on the user experience that the content strategy was overlooked.</p>

                    <p>This was revealed through internal testings on the structure of the filter menu for the content categories and topics — a task that was outsourced and with much delay, fell into one of the last steps of the project.</p>
                    
                    <p>Page results would return improperly tagged content and even displayed a unexpected empty pages at times. We learned that there were no set guidelines in how the tags are created, hence, the undesired results when the boxes are checked in the filter menu.</p>
                    
                    <p>The first step of our solution was to limit the content uploads to one individual, the Web Manager. We also consulted our SEO specialist for keywords to bring into focus during the tagging process.
                    
                    An overhaul of the content review was a necessary next step to clean up the tagged properties in the Resource Centert. Due to timing constraints, the tagging process still required further refinement.

                            <p>The old blog article page <i>(left)</i> had a text box that was stretched a little too wide for efficient reading and an unnecessary right rail—it housed an inconsistent word cloud and a defunct email capture.

                    <h3><b>A growing collaboration</b></h3>
                    <p>Over the span of four months, our team grew and so did the list of collaborators.</p> 

                    <p>The project started with the request from the B2B team. We worked closely with them to identify the core personas and the topics relevant to their industries.</p>
                        
                    <p>We engaged the SEO consultant along the way as she provided the insights on top performing pages. Any low-ranking pages within the Resource Center were removed. There were recommendations on keeping tagged pages to maintain the rankings of our most searched keywords.</p>

                    <p>Part of the major upgrade in the redesign was the addition of the filter menu that allows the user to select multiple criteria to refine their content search. Our development team collaborated with a former developer who built the previous resource center to integrate the filtration logic. The process gained good momentum until it hit a few coding mishaps that led to delaying the launch date.</p>
                        
                    <p>The Web team, a department of the larger Studio team, is in constant collaboration with the Content team. It was through conversations with the Content Director that we learned how crucial the filter menu is for the Content Team as part of their research process.</p>

The overall page views <mark>increased by 75% with an increase of 89% for the average time spent on blog article pages</mark>, the main chunk of content on the resource center.</p>

                   <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                   <p>The redesign of the resource center illustrated a great opportunity to rethink and reframe our content strategy. We encountered unplanned content auditing only to learn that it should have been prompted as one of the initial phases of the project. If more time was allowed, I think we would benefit from brainstorming sessions between cross channel teams to ultimately guide one central content experience.</p>

                <h3>An ever-evolving hub</h3>
                <p>Once we had the over redesign and updated templates in place, we shifted our focus to the visual updates as the next phase. Our design team has been working with illustrators a library of custom icons and graphics across the DailyPay website and products. Along with this development, secondary color palettes were explored and I saw the potential in updating image assets and color coding to categorize the large amount of content. Though a few rounds of iterations were expected, the designs went through the initial iteration before a team restructuring placed an indefinite hold on the project.</p>
