				<h2>overview</h2>
				<p>Community art creates attachment to one’s city. The art can be commemorative, provocative or celebratory, but good public art respects that we hold complex and invested thoughts about our communal space.
				Based out of Vancouver, BC, Strada is a mobile app development providing a platform to connect the city’s young art scene with a wider audience both locally and globally. The solution not only invites the active participation of the art enthusiasts but also the most disinterested viewer to connect with the public art shaping our communities.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="content" id="problem">
				<h2>the problem</h2>
				<p>My challenge was to understand the motives that drive both art enthusiasts and the general public to engage with public art by creating a platform for their participation.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<h2>the solution</h2>
				<p>The smartphone has now become an indispensable medium in many aspects of contemporary society. It serves as the main device for many consumers to complete both personal and work tasks. In order to make a tool more accessible, developing it as a mobile component is definitely crucial. Therefore, my solution is to design a mobile application that offers a seamless interaction experience between the viewers and artists to inspire the growth of public art in their communities.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="content" id="process">
				<h2>the process</h2>
				<h3>// research, survey & personas</h3>
				<p>My target market was determined by sending a survey through various social media platforms. Interviews were conducted to further understand the users’ experiences and frustrations with other applications used for content sharing.</p><p>The data revealed the users favour an easy-to-use application that offers simple management of art-related content. Users were frustrated with apps providing too much irrelevant content and notifications in their daily feed.</p>
				<p>Users are keen on the interaction between their peers when sharing contents through competitor applications. Features such as connecting with the artists and walking tours of local public art were also desired.</p>
				<p>Through the survey responses, I decided to build an application that delivers ease of sharing, limits the feed clutter and allows interaction between the public and the artists. Creating user personas provided a guideline for my design process by documenting users’ goals and frustrations.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<h3>// competitive analysis</h3>
				<p>A SWOT analysis was completed based on three competitor tools used for connecting and sharing art-related content: Facebook, Instagram and email. While Facebook has a massive audience reach, its wide community for social interaction can create too much noise for the user looking to have a controlled feed of relevant content. Instagram is heavily image-driven but it lacks in image quality. Email is a tool most people have access to, however it lacks in live-interaction and geomapping. From the research, I learned to focus on the best features to incorporate into the mobile app that would help solve the problems of the users.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<h3>// user stories & user flows</h3>
				<p>A list of user stories and user flows were generated to help identify and prioritize the user’s actions. Through the user stories, I was able to determine the minimum viable product features to focus on.</p>
				<p>The user flows helped me define the extent of what I needed to build and realize to test the application’s first prototype.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<h3>// wireframes</h3>
				<p>I wanted to test the user flows to see if the tasks are streamlined for the users. I recruited existing participants from the survey as well as some new participants in hopes that they would provide a different perspective as they had no prior knowledge of the application. The wireframes were created through Balsamiq and the participants’ interactions were recorded during the process. The results from the usability test provided me with many takeaways. My main focus was to make adjustments to navigation buttons to better communicate their call to action. There were also too many unnecessary ‘more options’ button that left the user confused, so they were to be reduced and streamlined.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<h3>// branding: logo, color & typography</h3>
				<p>Strada is derived from the Italian word for ‘street’. The logo stems from the brand’s vision to promote a sense of continuity and engagement within an art community. The dashed line of the letter ‘S’ conveys the ongoing growth of communal art as the curves of the ‘S’ loops around forming the infinity symbol. The bold and lively colour palette is inspired by the vivid and dynamic graffiti covering the hidden walls in downtown Vancouver.</p>
				<p>The chosen font Roboto has a form that renders with crisp and modern aesthetics. Its geometric forms evoke the shape element used in art. The sans-serif’s friendly and open curves allow for easy reading on screens of various sizes.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<h3>// mockup & prototype</h3>
				<p>After adjustments on the wireframes, usability tests were performed using a clickable InVision mockup to ensure the user flows were logical. The main takeaway was to clarify call-to-action button placements.</p>
				<p>Several iterations were produced before landing onto the final prototype. Through the process, main navigation items were relocated for better usability and colour positioning was refined so to complement the contents.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="content" id="conclusion">
				<h2>conclusion</h2>
				<p>The biggest challenge for me was my lack of fluency with the common user flows on social media applications as I’m not active on any of them. Though I had asked my peers for their experiences, I found it was easier to familiarized myself by researching social media user interface patterns and downloading the applications to simulate the flows.</p>
				<p>I’ve learned how crucial it is to perform user tests as early as possible. By doing so, this would allow me to figure out whether or not the flows are successful at an early stage, which in turn would give me more time to implement other tasks for testing. For one, preference tests would have been helpful in learning which call-to-action button the users prefer for the confirming their completion of the caption data entry.</p>
				<p>For a while, I was too fixated on creating this application for multiple roles. As I was creating the stories for each of the roles, I started thinking too deeply of certain features to incorporate that perhaps are more nice-to-haves than the prioritized features. The result left me overwhelmed as I tried to wrap my head around solutions to realize these features –I started to lose the vision of the project. I’ve learned the importance of MVPs in product development and that the application can always be developed further for more features in the future.</p>
