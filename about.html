		 				<p><strong>At the age of five,</strong> it was all about exploring with my hands. I spent the summer living with my aunt and uncle. From Japanese quilts draped over the chairs to framed floral illustrations on the walls to paper clay sculptures on every flat surface possible, their home was filled with a range of crafty handmade objects that my aunt took all the credit for. We spent an afternoon with paper clay and she showed me how she sculpted these doll-like figurines. Following her steps, I struggled and created my own version of “dolls”. I didn’t know I would have so much fun kneading and molding away with this white gooey stuff. That summer flew by. I had all the resources to draw and produce anything I wanted; it was a mini art retreat for my young soul. Little did I know that experience was just the beginning of my journey through the realms of art and design.</p>

						<p><strong>Growing up, there were times</strong> I felt rushed and frustrated at seeing my peers excel academically while I struggled. Math and I never got along; I hated it. Art classes were always the ones I looked forward to each week. At a young age, I discovered I learned better with the hands-on-approach. I knew I wanted to work with my hands; I wanted to create things. I just didn’t know how to apply my skills. Then that day came; I remember that day very vividly. I was circling around frantically looking for a spot in the ever-so-populated parking lot at Granville Island. Everyone was there for the National Portfolio Day at Emily Carr University. Walking through the halls, every turn was a sea of young aspiring artists and designers lugging large black portfolios and canvases of all sizes, all anxiously waiting to meet with representatives from numerous accredited art schools for their portfolio critiques. Not knowing what to expect, I dragged my best friend with me for the experience and the moral support. I found the line for Emily Carr and waited for what seemed like 10 hours for my turn. Nervously, I unzipped my portfolio and before I knew it the review was over. I went home that day feeling a few steps ahead then I did a year ago. It has always been uncomfortable for me to share my work for the fear of judgment. The critique with my representative was neither good nor bad but it gave me a push to continue my passion. Four weeks later, I received a letter from Emily Carr –I had gotten accepted to the university through the Portfolio Day. It was a rare opportunity; it was the first time I felt a sense of belonging.</p>

						<p><strong>One of my first moments</strong> of inspirations came when I discovered classical architecture as a schoolgirl. My dad took me on a cruise tour along the Huangpu River during my first visit to Shanghai. I was in awe seeing the strip of historical buildings of the Bund. The juxtaposition between the past and the present, the western-style landmarks against the towering skyscrapers, it was unlike anything I thought of the city. Since then, every visit to a foreign city I’ve documented architecture of all kinds. My eyes saw graphic elements forming from these 3-dimensional components. Whether it was the intricate carvings of a temple in Taichung, the nautical features on Liberty London’s Tudor-style building or the colour palette of the bizarrely whimsical Hunterwasserhaus, I design with these memories in mind. Along with other sources collected on the way, my bank of inspirations keeps growing as it helps pave the way for my work.</p>
