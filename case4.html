                   <h2>Overview</h2>
                   <p>Friday is a banking platform and personal card product from DailyPay, an earned wage access employee benefit. The launch of this product would give employees more options to access their pay on-demand. It allows for greater financial transparency so they can see their earnings and spending all in one place.</p> 
                    <p>2022 was a year of significant transition for DailyPay — Friday was the first product added to the company’s portfolio aside from the DailyPay product itself. With collaboration in cross-functional teams, the launch itself was about six months in the making. Our team’s challenge was to educate two audiences on the product, which led to the creation of a clean, simple microsite.</p>

                    <h3><b>The Discovery</b></h3>
                    <p>Initial research documents from cross-functioning teams were available to us. We layered in our own competitive research, stakeholder discussions, and working sessions, to land on a microsite experience that would capture the peace of mind and possibility (of more moments of joy, relief, and life)  behind our tagline “Make Every Day Friday”.</p>
                    <p>We looked at the competitive landscape and focused on three brands.</p>

                    <p>While the content, design, and UX patterns were similar across all, they were sparse in displaying any emotional benefits of their product.</p>

                    <h2>Expanding the brand</h2>
                    <p>We had access to a lightweight brand guideline. It was started by the Product team in their early stages of app and card design explorations and they were open to any additional concepts we had to expand the branding.</p>
                    <p>Through some of my initial creative explorations, it was discovered that the two primary colors did not play nice together. While opacity and gradients came in handy to break up the vibrancy of the primaries, it was ultimately the introduction of DailyPay’s secondary color palette that created the depth to pull the two colors together.</p>

                            <p>Heavy application of the blue was not favorite in our rounds of reviews <i>(left)</i>; it echoed too much of a traditional bank.

                    <h2>Striking the right balance</h2>
                    <p>In a heavily regulated space, one of the challenges was to meet the requirements of our internal legal team and financial service partner. Disclosures were requested to be readily accessible in reference to their respective content. After a few rounds of legal reviews, the legal agreement lengths outgrew the content and it began to sacrifice the design which made an impact to the experience.</p>
                    <p>To address the requirements while keeping our users happy, my recommended solution was to add hyperlinks to the superscripts — this kept the small copy light and directed the user straight to the text of the agreement.</p>
